     The font-size property specifies the size of the text. It can be specified as a fixed size in various units, <br>
     a percentage, or as a predefined keyword. The  unit lets you size font in terms of pixels, which is the unit <br>
     also used to size images and other elements. The default font-size for body text is typically 12px. There <br>
     are various keywords that can be used for less precise sizing: xx-small, x-small, small, medium, large, <br>
     x-large, xx-large. There are several options for relative sizing: percentage (120%) and ems (1.2em) that will <br>
     size the font relative to the body size. There are also two relative keywords, that will size the font relative  <br>
     to its inherited size: smaller, larger.   <br>
