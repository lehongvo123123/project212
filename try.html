    <strong> Eat a balanced diet of foods that are high-fiber, healthy fats, low-sugar, and low-salt</strong>. A healthy diet gives you more energy and improves your outlook and moods.
    High-fiber diets help keep you regular, and lower your risk for stroke, heart disease, and diabetes, while excess salt can increase your risk for these complications. Sugar 
     causes short energy spikes that can lead to a crash later. It has also been linked to depression and diabetes. <br>
     <p>
    <li>Healthy fats can be found in foods such as fish, nuts, and avocados</li>
    <li>Eat lots of leafy green vegetables. Kale, broccoli, cabbage and other leafy greens are packed full of essential vitamins and nutrients.</li>
    <li>Whole foods such as fruit and vegetables have more than enough sugar to give your body what it needs.</li>
    <li>Limit your fruit intake. While fruit does contain essential nutrients, it is also very high in sugar. <br>Eating too much fruit can be just as bad as eating a cookie.</li>
